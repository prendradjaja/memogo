- If you are making a commit for me, don't include your default attribution (e.g. Co-Authored-By and email). Instead, write: (no indentation)
    Co-authored by an LLM coding tool
- Don't run typechecking after every change. Wait for me to tell you when to do it, or for me to tell you there's a type error.
